I have experience with children who have mild to severe disabilities, and with ages ranging from three to fourteen years. I am currently work for a company that supports kids with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and that is where I am most passionate. <br><br>\n\n        My interest in special education began when I was a young child, after learning about my late uncle with ASD. Back in the 60s, the resources for people with special needs were very scarce. When he was six, my family was advised to send my uncle to live in a facility where he could receive professional attention at all times. Today, this kind of support and suggestion would not be acceptable or ethical. Now, there are many interventions for children with autism starting as early as six months old. There is more research to support these individuals and get them and their families true help to set them up for success. One type of intervention is called Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). ABA is a scientific approach to provide therapy for children who need behavior modification. Since learning the basics of ABA at my first job as a Paraeducator, I have been practicing full time. <br><br>\n\nAs a Paraeducator, I used ABA in a school setting. I worked with students 1:1, during private sessions throughout the school day. Behavior modification in a school setting included helping children sit appropriately in class, at a desk, and play appropriately with peers and adults. The children were typically between the ages of 3-5, and this type of intervention was significant at this age. During this time, children are starting school for the first time and trying to make friends. In addition to my ABA experience in a school setting, I currently work for a private company that provides ABA services in homes. <br><br>\nProviding ABA therapy to children in their homes is my preferred way of working. While working in their home, the child is more comfortable and the main objective is to help them in their natural environment. They practice chores around the house and other tasks to make them successful on their own. This is a field that I very much enjoy and the education program at UCR has provided me the tools necessary for success after I graduate. After my time at UCR, I plan to attend grad school and fulfill a professional career in ABA. \n</p>\n        <div class=\"social-icons\">\n          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://linkedin.com\">\n            <i class=\"fab fa-linkedin-in\"></i>\n          </a>\n          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com\">\n            <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>\n          </a>\n          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com\">\n            <i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i>\n          </a>\n          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:youremail@gmail.com\">\n            <i class=\"fa fa-envelope\"></i>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n    <hr class=\"m-0\">\n\n    <section class=\"resume-section p-3 p-lg-5 d-flex justify-content-center\" id=\"experience\">\n      <div class=\"w-100\">\n        <h2 class=\"mb-5\">Experience</h2>\n\n        <div class=\"resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between mb-5\">\n          <div class=\"resume-content\">\n            <h3 class=\"mb-0\">Behavior Interventionist</h3>\n            <div class=\"subheading mb-3\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mulesoft.com\">Guiding Behavior Outcomes</a></div>\n            <p>\n              • Provide support for children with ASD and their families<br> \n              • Handling confidential information and follow HIPPA compliance<br>\n              • Applied Behavior Analysis<br>\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"resume-date text-md-right\">\n            <span class=\"text-primary\">June 2019 - Present</span>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between mb-5\">\n          <div class=\"resume-content\">\n            <h3 class=\"mb-0\">Paraeducator</h3>\n            <div class=\"subheading mb-3\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pubnub.com\">Lake Elsinore Unified School District</a></div>\n            <p>\n              • Provide support for students with moderate to severe disabilities in a special education classroom<br>\n              • Applied Behavior Analysis, G-Tube feeding, diapering<br>\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"resume-date text-md-right\">\n            <span class=\"text-primary\">December 2016 - September 2019</span>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n\n        <div class=\"resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between mb-5\">\n          <div class=\"resume-content\">\n            <h3 class=\"mb-0\">Shift Lead</h3>\n            <div class=\"subheading mb-3\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ucr.edu\">Five Guys Burgers & Fries</a></div>\n            <p>\n            • Lead team during shifts<br>\n            • Key holder<br>\n            • Basic kitchen safety knowledge<br>\n          </p>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"resume-date text-md-right\">\n            <span class=\"text-primary\">June 2015 - February 2017</span>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n\n    </section>\n\n    <hr class=\"m-0\">\n\n    <section class=\"resume-section p-3 p-lg-5 d-flex align-items-center\" id=\"education\">\n      <div class=\"w-100\">\n        <h2 class=\"mb-5\">Education</h2>\n\n        <div class=\"resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between mb-5\">\n          <div class=\"resume-content\">\n            <h3 class=\"mb-0\">UC Riverside</h3>\n            <div class=\"subheading mb-3\">Bachelor of Arts</div>\n            <div>Education, Society, and Human Development</div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"resume-date text-md-right\">\n            <span class=\"text-primary\">September 2018 - Present</span>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between mb-5\">\n          <div class=\"resume-content\">\n            <h3 class=\"mb-0\">Mt.
